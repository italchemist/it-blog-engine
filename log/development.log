Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, наример в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на github.com. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки с удовлетворяющие предлженным критериям пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:\n* <a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.\n* И множество другий, включая статически движки.</p>\n\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движёк, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Вот для примера так выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["title", "IT Blog Engine!"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, наример в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на github.com. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предлженным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество другий, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движёк, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, дижок для блогов"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <code>./.oh-my-zsh/custom</code>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin_name}/\#{plugin_name}.plugin.zsh</code></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <code>cd_to_project</code>, который будет выполнять <code>cd</code> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<code>./.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd_to_project/cd_to_project.plugin.zsh</code>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <code>prj</code> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <code>.zshrc</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd_to_project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <code>prj</code>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <code>./.oh-my-zsh/custom</code>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin_name}/\#{plugin_name}.plugin.zsh</code></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <code>cd_to_project</code>, который будет выполнять <code>cd</code> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<code>./.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd_to_project/cd_to_project.plugin.zsh</code>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <code>prj</code> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <code>.zshrc</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd_to_project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <code>prj</code>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin_name}/\#{plugin_name}.plugin.zsh</code></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <code>cd_to_project</code>, который будет выполнять <code>cd</code> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<code>./.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd_to_project/cd_to_project.plugin.zsh</code>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <code>prj</code> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <code>.zshrc</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd_to_project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <code>prj</code>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <code>./.oh-my-zsh/custom</code>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin_name}/\#{plugin_name}.plugin.zsh</code></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <code>cd_to_project</code>, который будет выполнять <code>cd</code> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<code>./.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd_to_project/cd_to_project.plugin.zsh</code>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <code>prj</code> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <code>.zshrc</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd_to_project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <code>prj</code>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd<em>to</em>project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd<em>to</em>project/cd<em>to</em>project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd_to_project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям.

Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!</p>"], ["date", Thu, 01 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "it-blog-engine-intro"], ["title", "IT Blog Engine - markdown, github, движок для блогов"]]

Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!

Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>\n\n<p>Вот ещё несколько полезных функций:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cdl() { cd $1 &amp;&amp; ls }\nmkcd() { mkdir $1 &amp;&amp; cd $1 }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Данная функция извлекает архив любого типа:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extract () {\n if [ -f $1 ] ; then\n case $1 in\n *.tar.bz2)   tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tar.gz)    tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.bz2)       bunzip2 $1    ;;\n *.rar)       unrar x $1    ;;\n *.gz)        gunzip $1     ;;\n *.tar)       tar xf $1     ;;\n *.tbz2)      tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tbz)       tar -xjvf $1  ;;\n *.tgz)       tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.zip)       unzip $1      ;;\n *.Z)         uncompress $1 ;;\n *.7z)        7z x $1       ;;\n *)           echo \"I don't know how to extract '$1'...\" ;;\n esac\n else\n echo \"'$1' is not a valid file\"\n fi\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно устанавливать алиасы на команды:</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias ls='ls --classify --color --human-readable --group-directories-first'\nalias s='sudo'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно настроить приложение которое будет открывать файлы по типу расширения</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias -s txt=nano\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Таким образом zsh очень легко конфигурируется под свои нужды.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>\n\n<p>Вот ещё несколько полезных функций:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cdl() { cd $1 &amp;&amp; ls }\nmkcd() { mkdir $1 &amp;&amp; cd $1 }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Данная функция извлекает архив любого типа:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extract () {\n if [ -f $1 ] ; then\n case $1 in\n *.tar.bz2)   tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tar.gz)    tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.bz2)       bunzip2 $1    ;;\n *.rar)       unrar x $1    ;;\n *.gz)        gunzip $1     ;;\n *.tar)       tar xf $1     ;;\n *.tbz2)      tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tbz)       tar -xjvf $1  ;;\n *.tgz)       tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.zip)       unzip $1      ;;\n *.Z)         uncompress $1 ;;\n *.7z)        7z x $1       ;;\n *)           echo \"I don't know how to extract '$1'...\" ;;\n esac\n else\n echo \"'$1' is not a valid file\"\n fi\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно устанавливать алиасы на команды:</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias ls='ls --classify --color --human-readable --group-directories-first'\nalias s='sudo'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно настроить приложение которое будет открывать файлы по типу расширения</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias -s txt=nano\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Таким образом zsh очень легко конфигурируется под свои нужды.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог.

Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>\n\n<p>Вот ещё несколько полезных функций:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cdl() { cd $1 &amp;&amp; ls }\nmkcd() { mkdir $1 &amp;&amp; cd $1 }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Данная функция извлекает архив любого типа:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extract () {\n if [ -f $1 ] ; then\n case $1 in\n *.tar.bz2)   tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tar.gz)    tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.bz2)       bunzip2 $1    ;;\n *.rar)       unrar x $1    ;;\n *.gz)        gunzip $1     ;;\n *.tar)       tar xf $1     ;;\n *.tbz2)      tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tbz)       tar -xjvf $1  ;;\n *.tgz)       tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.zip)       unzip $1      ;;\n *.Z)         uncompress $1 ;;\n *.7z)        7z x $1       ;;\n *)           echo \"I don't know how to extract '$1'...\" ;;\n esac\n else\n echo \"'$1' is not a valid file\"\n fi\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно устанавливать алиасы на команды:</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias ls='ls --classify --color --human-readable --group-directories-first'\nalias s='sudo'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно настроить приложение которое будет открывать файлы по типу расширения</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias -s txt=nano\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Таким образом zsh очень легко конфигурируется под свои нужды.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!

[["content", "<p>Доброго времени суток!</p>\n\n<p>Терминал является очень нужной штукой, это и так все знают. Однако, не все настраивают под свои нужды. Этим сейчас и займёмся. Настраивать, естественно, будем <em>zsh</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Установка ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Для начала установим <em>oh my zsh</em> - разрабатываемый сообществом фреймвёрк для настройки zsh. Включает более 40+ плагинов (<em>rails</em>, <em>git</em>, <em>OSX</em>, <em>hub</em>, <em>capistrano</em>, <em>brew</em>, <em>ant</em>, <em>macports</em>, и другие), более 80 тем, и систему обновления для того чтобы поддерживать скрипты в актуальном состоянии. Хостится на гитхабе: <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a></p>\n\n<p>Устанавливаем согласно инструкции: (на сайте предложены различные варианты установки, включая ручной)</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Теперь включим необходимые плагины, отредактировав ./.zshrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git rails ruby)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>На этом базовая настройка закончена, что уже даёт огромное количество возможностей. Однако, перейдём к созданию своего собственной конфигурации.</p>\n\n<h2>Свой плагин для ZSH</h2>\n\n<p>Файл будет загружен автоматиески если просто поместить его в <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em>. Однако если нужно создать плагин, то структура должна быть такой: <em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/\#{plugin<em>name}/\#{plugin</em>name}.plugin.zsh</em></p>\n\n<p>Я создам плагин <em>cd-to-project</em>, который будет выполнять <em>cd</em> до директории с проектом. Так выглядит плагин (<em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/cd-to-project/cd-to-project.plugin.zsh</em>):</p>\n\n<pre>prj() { cd ~/Projects/$1; }\n_prj() { _files -W ~/Projects -/; }\ncompdef _prj prj</pre>\n\n<p>Первая строка объявляет комманду <em>prj</em> и её действие. Вторая строка - предоставление автодополнения. Всё что вернёт эта функция будет предложено для автодополнения. Третья строка указывает какой команде какая функция атодополнения соответствует.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь нужно добавить плагин в <em>.zshrc</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>plugins=(git cd-to-project)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>После перезапуска терминала данный плагин будет работать. Нужно набрать <em>prj</em>, пробел и нажать <em>tab</em> два раза для автодополнения.</p>\n\n<p>Вот ещё несколько полезных функций:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cdl() { cd $1 &amp;&amp; ls }\nmkcd() { mkdir $1 &amp;&amp; cd $1 }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Данная функция извлекает архив любого типа:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extract () {\n if [ -f $1 ] ; then\n case $1 in\n *.tar.bz2)   tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tar.gz)    tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.bz2)       bunzip2 $1    ;;\n *.rar)       unrar x $1    ;;\n *.gz)        gunzip $1     ;;\n *.tar)       tar xf $1     ;;\n *.tbz2)      tar xjf $1    ;;\n *.tbz)       tar -xjvf $1  ;;\n *.tgz)       tar xzf $1    ;;\n *.zip)       unzip $1      ;;\n *.Z)         uncompress $1 ;;\n *.7z)        7z x $1       ;;\n *)           echo \"I don't know how to extract '$1'...\" ;;\n esac\n else\n echo \"'$1' is not a valid file\"\n fi\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно устанавливать алиасы на команды:</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias ls='ls --classify --color --human-readable --group-directories-first'\nalias s='sudo'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Также можно настроить приложение которое будет открывать файлы по типу расширения</p>\n\n<pre><code>alias -s txt=nano\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Таким образом zsh очень легко конфигурируется под свои нужды.</p>"], ["date", Fri, 02 Nov 2012], ["permalink", "zsh-configuration"], ["title", "ZSH"]]

Каким он должен быть? Как мне кажется, он должен удовлетворять следующим критериям:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Статьи пишутся в <em>markdown</em>. Никаких <em>wysiwyg</em>, ибо вставлять и редактировать код с такой концепцией крайне тяжело. Кто пробовал делать это, например в <em>wordpress</em> поймёт.</li>\n<li>Web-интерфейс для создания/редактирования статей как таковой не нужен. Достаточно простого <em>off-line</em> редактора текста.</li>\n<li>Все статьи должны храниться и извлекаться для обработки из репозитария. Например на <em>github.com</em>. Таким образом, достигается архивирование статей и их версионность.</li>\n<li>Обновление статей должно выполняться посредством нажатия одной кнопки \"Обновить\", что инициирует процесс выгрузки статей из репозитария и обновления их в <em>БД</em>.</li>\n<li>Никакой дополнительный софт, кроме системы контроля версий не должен требоваться.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Поискав в сети движки, удовлетворяющие предложенным критериям, пришёл к выводу, что таких нет. Вот некоторые из кандидатов:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">http://octopress.org/</a> - требует <em>ruby</em> на стороне клиента.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natew/obtvse\">https://github.com/natew/obtvse</a> - нет интеграции с системой контроля версий.</li>\n<li>И множество других, включая статически движки.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Таким образом было принято решение, написать свой блоговый движок, который бы удовлетворял всем предложенным требованиям. Итак, вот он: <a href=\"https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine\">https://github.com/italchemist/it-blog-engine</a></p>\n\n<p>Собственно, именно на этом движке и работает сей блог. Таким образом, для примера, выглядит данная статья:</p>\n\n<pre><code>title: IT Blog Engine!\ndate: 2012-11-01\nid: it-blog-engine-intro\n\nТекст статьи.\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Приятного использования!
